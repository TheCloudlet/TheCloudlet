# Welcome to The Cloudlet

_A quiet space for tools, thoughts, and timeless flows._

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Cloudlet** — a calm builder, compiler whisperer, and systems thinker.  
I like writing tools that reduce friction, code that breathes, and notes that last.

As a VHDL Compiler Engineer, I deal with the messy reality of industrial-grade C++. However, I look to LISP and Haskell for clarity and wisdom. My goal is to bring the safety and expressiveness of functional programming into the performance-critical world of systems programming.

I document my journey and architectural decisions—including the mistakes and the "Why"—on my [Technical Blog](https://thecloudlet.github.io/).

I’m slowly building my digital garden —  
but if you’d like to reach out, just leave a star, open an issue, or say hi.
